# Attendance Management Project - Part 1

##  Goal

Set up the foundational structure for the Attendance Management Project using Java.

##  Tasks Completed

- Created a new Java project with the required directory structure.
- Added a `Main.java` file that prints a welcome message.
- Compiled and ran the Java file successfully.
- Added a `README.md` file.
- Created a GitHub repository following the naming convention.
- Created a new branch (`part-01`) and pushed the initial project setup.
- Submitted a Pull Request with:
  - Project setup
  - Java welcome file



## Part 3: Constructor Initialization & Auto-ID Generation
- Implemented parameterized constructors in `Student` and `Course` classes for object initialization.
- Utilized `private static` member variables for automatic and unique ID generation.
- Demonstrated the use of the `this` keyword to distinguish instance variables from constructor parameters.
- Changed `Course`'s `courseId` to `int` for simpler auto-generation and updated its display.
- Updated `Main.java` to use constructors and show ID progression.
